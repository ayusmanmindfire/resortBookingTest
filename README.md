## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to evaluate a developer’s ability to:

- Understand an unfamiliar codebase
- Debug frontend issues independently
- Reason about UI behavior and data flow
- Work with DOM manipulation and basic state management
- Identify inconsistencies between UI, logic, and expected behavior

---

## 🏨 Application Overview

The dashboard allows users to:

- Create resort bookings

2. Interact with the booking form
3. Observe UI behavior and application responses
4. Use browser developer tools as needed
5. Make corrections incrementally and validate changes
